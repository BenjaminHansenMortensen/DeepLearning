#### Course Goals
<g> Artificial neural networks are flexible and powerful machine learning models. 
Modern deep learning has had tremendous success in applying complex 
neural networks to problems from a wide range of disciplines. 
This course gives and understanding of the theoretical basis underlying neural networks and deep learning. 
Furthermore, the course includes implementation of neural 
components and as well as applying deep learning on real-world data sets using 
modern deep learning packages. </g>


##### The main goals of this course is: 

- Project 1
  - [x] Feedforward neural networks
  - [x] Learning with stochastic gradient descent, back-propagation
    - [x] Implemented back - propagation by hand
  - [x] Improving learning by optimisation and regularisation
    - [x] Manual implementation of L1 & L2 regularisation
- Project 2 
  - [x] Convolutional neural networks
    - [x] Object Localization
    - [x] Object Detection (Multiple)
- Project 3
  - [x] Recurrent neural networks 
    - [x] LSTM'S 
    - [x] Text recognition and analysis 
    - [x] Beam Search


So after this course we should have a basic understanding of the *theories* and *ideas* behind 
various deep learning techniques as well as skills to *use* deep learning in practice using modern
programming frameworks.
