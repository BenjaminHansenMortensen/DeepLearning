#### Course Goals
<g> Artificial neural networks are flexible and powerful machine learning models. 
Modern deep learning has had tremendous success in applying complex 
neural networks to problems from a wide range of disciplines. 
This course gives and understanding of the theoretical basis underlying neural networks and deep learning. 
Furthermore, the course includes implementation of neural 
components and as well as applying deep learning on real-world data sets using 
modern deep learning packages. </g>


##### The main goals of this course is: 

- Project 1
  - [x] Feedforward neural networks
  - [x] Learning with stochastic gradient descent, back-propagation
    - [x] Implemented back - propagation by hand
  - [x] Improving learning by optimisation and regularisation
    - [x] Manual implementation of L1 & L2 regularisation
- Project 2 Convolution Neural Networks
  - [x] Object Localization
    - [x] Familiarization With The Training Data
    - [x] Three Variation of LeNet05 Architecture
    - [x] CustomLoss Function Implementation
    - [x] Defining Intersection over Union & Bounding Box
    - [x] Best Model Results and Showcase
  - [x] Object Detection (Multiple Localizations)
    - TODO
- Project 3: Recurrent Neural Networks
  - [x] 2.1: Word Embeddings
    - [x] Create Datasets With Before Word Context
    - [x] Define Three MLP Models
    - [x] Train Word Embeddings With The Best Model
    - [x] Calculate Cosine Similarity For Word Similarity
    - [x] Display and Storing of Similar Words (embedd.tsv)
  - [x] 2.2: RNN vs MLP Comparison
    - [x] Create Datasets With Between Context For Conjugates
    - [x] Define Two MLP Models and Two RNN Models
    - [x] Train Models Selecting The Best
    - [x] Compare Time Spent Training
  - [x] 2.3: Text Generator
    - [x] Load New Dataset With Before Word Context
    - [x] Define Two RNN Models
    - [x] Train The Models Selecting The Best
    - [x] Beam Search Algorithm For Word Selection
    - [x] Text Generation Examples
  

So after this course we should have a basic understanding of the *theories* and *ideas* behind 
various deep learning techniques as well as skills to *use* deep learning in practice using modern
programming frameworks.

OBS: All training is done with very limited resources, thus the model accuracy is not the focus here
