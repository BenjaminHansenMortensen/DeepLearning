#### Course Goals
<g> Artificial neural networks are flexible and powerful machine learning models. 
Modern deep learning has had tremendous success in applying complex 
neural networks to problems from a wide range of disciplines. 
This course gives and understanding of the theoretical basis underlying neural networks and deep learning. 
Furthermore, the course includes implementation of neural 
components and as well as applying deep learning on real-world data sets using 
modern deep learning packages. </g>

OBS: All training is done with very limited resources, thus the model accuracy is not the focus here.
We also do NOT claim ownership of any code or files in this repo. And is only ment as a hobby project in
correlation with a deep learning course (INF265) taken at the University of Bergen (UiB) the spring of 2022.


##### The main goals of this course is: 

- Project 1: Implementation of Deep Learning from Scratch

  - [x] RNN vs MLP Comparison
    - [x] Create Datasets With Between Context For Conjugates
    - [x] Define Two MLP Models and Two RNN Models
    - [x] Train Models Selecting The Best
    - [x] Compare Time Spent Training

So after this course we should have a basic understanding of the *theories* and *ideas* behind 
various deep learning techniques as well as skills to *use* deep learning in practice using modern
programming frameworks.
